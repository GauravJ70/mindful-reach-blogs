      <h2>Introduction to Web Accessibility</h2>
      <p>Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools. When websites are properly designed and coded, users with disabilities can use them effectively.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Accessibility Matters</h3>
      <p>Approximately 15% of the world's population lives with some form of disability. Creating accessible websites isn't just the right thing to do—it's also good business. Accessible sites have better SEO, reach wider audiences, demonstrate social responsibility, and often provide a better user experience for everyone.</p>
      
      <h3>The Four Principles of Accessibility</h3>
      <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are organized around four principles, often referred to as POUR:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Perceivable</strong>: Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</li>
        <li><strong>Operable</strong>: User interface components and navigation must be operable by all users.</li>
        <li><strong>Understandable</strong>: Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable.</li>
        <li><strong>Robust</strong>: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Practical Implementation Steps</h2>
      
      <h3>Semantic HTML</h3>
      <p>Using proper HTML elements for their intended purpose is one of the simplest yet most powerful accessibility techniques:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!-- Instead of this --&gt;
&lt;div class="heading"&gt;This looks like a heading&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- Use this --&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;This is semantically a heading&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h3>ARIA When Necessary</h3>
      <p>WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications) provides attributes to enhance accessibility when standard HTML is insufficient:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;div role="button" tabindex="0" aria-pressed="false"&gt;
  Toggle Feature
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Keyboard Navigation</h3>
      <p>Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard. This includes managing focus states and creating logical tab order.</p>
      
      <h3>Text Alternatives</h3>
      <p>Always provide text alternatives for non-text content:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;img src="chart.png" alt="Bar chart showing sales increase of 25% in Q3" /&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Testing Your Implementation</h2>
      <p>Accessibility testing should include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automated testing tools like Lighthouse, axe, or WAVE</li>
        <li>Manual keyboard navigation testing</li>
        <li>Testing with screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver</li>
        <li>Color contrast checking</li>
        <li>User testing with people who have disabilities</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Building accessible websites takes practice but becomes second nature over time. Start with the basics, incorporate accessibility from the beginning of projects, and continuously learn. Remember that accessibility benefits everyone, not just users with disabilities. By creating accessible web experiences, you're helping build a more inclusive digital world.</p>

      <h2>Understanding WCAG Guidelines: An Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world. WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
      
      <h3>WCAG Versions and Compliance Levels</h3>
      <p>Currently, WCAG 2.1 is the recommended version, though organizations should be aware that WCAG 2.2 is now published and WCAG 3.0 is in development.</p>
      
      <p>Each WCAG guideline has three conformance levels:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Level A</strong>: The minimum level of conformance, addressing the most basic web accessibility features.</li>
        <li><strong>Level AA</strong>: The target for most organizations and addresses the most common barriers for disabled users. This is often the legal requirement in many jurisdictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Level AAA</strong>: The highest level of conformance, providing enhanced accessibility for specialized audiences.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>The Four Core Principles</h3>
      
      <h4>1. Perceivable</h4>
      <p>Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. Key requirements include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Text alternatives for non-text content</li>
        <li>Captions and alternatives for multimedia</li>
        <li>Content that can be presented in different ways</li>
        <li>Content that is easier to see and hear</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>2. Operable</h4>
      <p>User interface components and navigation must be operable. Key requirements include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All functionality available from a keyboard</li>
        <li>Users have enough time to read and use content</li>
        <li>Content that doesn't cause seizures or physical reactions</li>
        <li>Users can easily navigate and find content</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>3. Understandable</h4>
      <p>Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable. Key requirements include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Text that is readable and understandable</li>
        <li>Content that appears and operates in predictable ways</li>
        <li>Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h4>4. Robust</h4>
      <p>Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies. Key requirements include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Content is compatible with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies</li>
        <li>Proper markup and clear communication</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Implementing WCAG in Your Projects</h2>
      
      <h3>Getting Started</h3>
      <p>The best way to approach WCAG compliance is to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Understand which level of conformance you need to meet (typically AA)</li>
        <li>Conduct an audit of your existing website using automated and manual testing</li>
        <li>Create a prioritized remediation plan</li>
        <li>Implement changes methodically, focusing on high-impact items first</li>
        <li>Incorporate accessibility testing into your development process</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Common WCAG Implementation Challenges</h3>
      <p>Organizations often struggle with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dynamic content accessibility</li>
        <li>Complex interactive elements like data tables and custom controls</li>
        <li>Form validation and error handling</li>
        <li>Multimedia accessibility (captions, audio descriptions)</li>
        <li>Mobile-specific accessibility concerns</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Legal Implications of WCAG</h2>
      <p>WCAG has been adopted as the technical standard in many legal frameworks worldwide:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In the U.S., the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act reference WCAG</li>
        <li>The European Accessibility Act (EAA) incorporates WCAG principles</li>
        <li>Many other countries have similar legislation</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Understanding and implementing WCAG is an ongoing process that requires commitment and resources. However, the benefits—reaching more users, improving user experience for everyone, and reducing legal risk—make it well worth the investment.</p>
      
      <p>Start your WCAG implementation journey today by conducting a simple audit and addressing the most critical issues first. Remember, progress is more important than perfection when it comes to accessibility.</p>

    "designing-for-screen-readers": `
      <h2>Introduction to Screen Readers</h2>
      <p>Screen readers are assistive technologies that convert digital text into synthesized speech or braille output. They are essential tools for people who are blind, have low vision, or have reading disabilities. Popular screen readers include JAWS and NVDA (Windows), VoiceOver (Apple), and TalkBack (Android).</p>
      
      <h3>How Screen Readers Work</h3>
      <p>Screen readers interact with a website's DOM (Document Object Model) and accessibility tree to interpret and announce content to users. They typically provide keyboard commands that allow users to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Navigate through headings, links, landmarks, and other elements</li>
        <li>Read text character-by-character, word-by-word, or as a continuous flow</li>
        <li>Interact with form controls and interactive components</li>
        <li>Access additional context about images and other non-text content</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Key Principles for Screen Reader Accessibility</h2>
      
      <h3>Semantic HTML Structure</h3>
      <p>Using semantic HTML elements is the foundation of screen reader accessibility. Screen readers rely on these elements to provide context and navigation options:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!-- Poor structure --&gt;
&lt;div class="header"&gt;Welcome&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="nav"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="content"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- Good structure --&gt;
&lt;header&gt;Welcome&lt;/header&gt;
&lt;nav&gt;...&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;main&gt;...&lt;/main&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Proper Heading Hierarchy</h3>
      <p>Screen reader users often navigate by headings, so a logical heading hierarchy is crucial:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!-- Avoid skipping levels --&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Main Title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;This should be an h2&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;!-- Incorrect --&gt;

&lt;!-- Use proper hierarchy --&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Main Title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Section Title&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Subsection Title&lt;/h3&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Descriptive Link Text</h3>
      <p>Screen reader users often navigate by jumping from link to link. Generic phrases like "click here" or "read more" provide no context when read in isolation:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!-- Poor link text --&gt;
&lt;a href="pricing.html"&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to see our pricing.

&lt;!-- Good link text --&gt;
&lt;a href="pricing.html"&gt;View our pricing plans&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Alternative Text for Images</h3>
      <p>All meaningful images need descriptive alternative text:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!-- Informative image --&gt;
&lt;img src="chart.png" alt="Q1 sales increased by 15% compared to last year" /&gt;

&lt;!-- Decorative image --&gt;
&lt;img src="divider.png" alt="" role="presentation" /&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Common Pitfalls and Solutions</h2>
      
      <h3>Hidden Content</h3>
      <p>Be careful with how you hide content. Using <code>display: none</code> or <code>visibility: hidden</code> will hide content from screen readers. If you want content to be visually hidden but available to screen readers, use a specialized CSS class:</p>
      <pre><code>.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  white-space: nowrap;
  border-width: 0;
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Custom Controls</h3>
      <p>When creating custom controls (e.g., dropdown menus, tabs, sliders), you must implement keyboard accessibility and proper ARIA attributes:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;div role="button" 
     tabindex="0" 
     aria-pressed="false"
     onclick="toggleFeature()"
     onkeydown="handleKeydown(event)"&gt;
  Toggle Feature
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Dynamic Content</h3>
      <p>When content updates dynamically, use ARIA live regions to ensure screen readers announce the changes:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;div aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"&gt;
  &lt;!-- Content that will update dynamically --&gt;
  Your form has been successfully submitted.
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Testing with Screen Readers</h2>
      <p>Don't rely solely on automated testing tools. Test with actual screen readers:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Turn off your monitor or close your eyes to simulate the screen reader user experience</li>
        <li>Try to complete common tasks using only the keyboard and screen reader</li>
        <li>Test with multiple screen readers if possible (NVDA, VoiceOver, JAWS)</li>
        <li>Include people who use screen readers in your user testing</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Designing for screen readers isn't just about compliance—it's about providing equal access to information. By following these best practices, you can ensure your web content is accessible to all users, regardless of how they interact with your site.</p>
      
      <p>Remember: what works for screen reader users typically improves accessibility for everyone, including those using voice recognition software, keyboard-only navigation, and other assistive technologies.</p>
    `,
    
    "color-contrast-accessibility": `
      <h2>The Importance of Color Contrast</h2>
      <p>Color contrast is a fundamental aspect of web accessibility that affects all users, but especially those with visual impairments. Adequate contrast between text and background colors ensures that content is readable for people with low vision, color blindness, or those using screens in bright environments.</p>
      
      <h3>Understanding Visual Impairments</h3>
      <p>Approximately 285 million people worldwide have some form of visual impairment. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low vision:</strong> Reduced visual acuity that cannot be corrected with standard glasses or contact lenses</li>
        <li><strong>Color blindness:</strong> Difficulty distinguishing between certain colors, affecting about 8% of men and 0.5% of women</li>
        <li><strong>Age-related vision changes:</strong> Natural deterioration of vision that affects most people as they age</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>WCAG Contrast Requirements</h2>
      <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide specific contrast ratios for compliance:</p>
      
      <h3>For Normal Text (Less Than 18pt or 14pt Bold)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AA compliance:</strong> Contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1</li>
        <li><strong>AAA compliance:</strong> Contrast ratio of at least 7:1</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>For Large Text (At Least 18pt or 14pt Bold)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AA compliance:</strong> Contrast ratio of at least 3:1</li>
        <li><strong>AAA compliance:</strong> Contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>For User Interface Components and Graphics</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AA compliance:</strong> Contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Testing Color Contrast</h2>
      <p>Several tools are available to help you evaluate color contrast:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>WebAIM Color Contrast Checker:</strong> A simple tool to check contrast ratios between foreground and background colors</li>
        <li><strong>Contrast Checker browser extensions:</strong> Tools like the Axe DevTools or WAVE extensions can identify contrast issues directly on your webpage</li>
        <li><strong>Design tool plugins:</strong> Plugins for Figma, Sketch, and Adobe XD can help designers check contrast during the design phase</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Best Practices for Color Contrast</h2>
      
      <h3>Use Sufficient Contrast for Text</h3>
      <pre><code>/* Poor contrast */
.low-contrast-text {
  color: #999999;
  background-color: #777777;
}

/* Good contrast */
.high-contrast-text {
  color: #FFFFFF;
  background-color: #333333;
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Don't Rely on Color Alone</h3>
      <p>Always use multiple cues beyond color to convey information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add patterns or textures to differentiate chart elements</li>
        <li>Use icons alongside color-coded status indicators</li>
        <li>Provide text labels for important information</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Consider Color Blindness</h3>
      <p>Be mindful of common color blindness types:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Deuteranopia and Protanopia:</strong> Difficulty distinguishing reds and greens</li>
        <li><strong>Tritanopia:</strong> Difficulty distinguishing blues and yellows</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tools like the Stark plugin for design software or Color Oracle can simulate how your design appears to people with color vision deficiencies.</p>
      
      <h3>Dark Mode Considerations</h3>
      <p>If your site offers dark mode, ensure that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Text contrast remains sufficient when colors are inverted</li>
        <li>Interactive elements remain distinguishable</li>
        <li>Images with transparency work well on both light and dark backgrounds</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Beyond Basic Contrast</h2>
      
      <h3>Typography Matters</h3>
      <p>Even with good color contrast, readability can be affected by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Font weight (too thin fonts can be hard to read)</li>
        <li>Font size (smaller text needs higher contrast)</li>
        <li>Line height and letter spacing</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Environmental Factors</h3>
      <p>Remember that users may view your site in various conditions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bright sunlight where screen glare reduces apparent contrast</li>
        <li>Night settings where too-bright screens can cause eye strain</li>
        <li>On devices with different color calibrations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Proper color contrast is not just an accessibility requirement—it's a fundamental principle of good design that improves usability for everyone. By meeting contrast standards, you ensure your content is perceivable by the widest possible audience while simultaneously creating a more professional and polished appearance.</p>
      
      <p>When designing your next project, make color contrast a priority from the beginning rather than an afterthought. Your users—all of them—will benefit.</p>
    `,
    
    "keyboard-navigation-techniques": `
      <h2>Why Keyboard Navigation Matters</h2>
      <p>Many users rely entirely on keyboards to navigate websites, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>People with motor impairments who cannot use a mouse</li>
        <li>People who use screen readers</li>
        <li>People with temporary limitations (e.g., broken arm, RSI)</li>
        <li>Power users who prefer keyboard shortcuts for efficiency</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When websites aren't properly designed for keyboard accessibility, these users face significant barriers that can prevent them from using the site entirely.</p>
      
      <h2>Core Keyboard Navigation Principles</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Focus Indication</h3>
      <p>Users must be able to see which element currently has keyboard focus. The default browser outline is often removed by CSS resets, so it's crucial to provide an alternative:</p>
      <pre><code>/* Don't do this without a replacement */
:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* Better approach */
:focus {
  outline: 2px solid #4D90FE;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>2. Logical Tab Order</h3>
      <p>The <code>Tab</code> key should move through interactive elements in a logical sequence, typically following the visual layout from top to bottom, left to right (in LTR languages):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid using <code>tabindex</code> values greater than 0, as they can disrupt the natural tab order</li>
        <li>Use <code>tabindex="0"</code> to make custom elements focusable</li>
        <li>Use <code>tabindex="-1"</code> for elements that should be programmatically focusable but not in the tab order</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Focus Management</h3>
      <p>Properly manage focus when content changes dynamically:</p>
      <pre><code>// After opening a modal
document.getElementById('modalCloseButton').focus();

// After form submission error
document.getElementById('firstErrorField').focus();</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Implementing Keyboard Navigation for Common UI Patterns</h2>
      
      <h3>Navigation Menus</h3>
      <p>For dropdown menus:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ensure the menu trigger is keyboard accessible</li>
        <li>When opened, trap focus within the dropdown</li>
        <li>Support arrow keys for navigation between menu items</li>
        <li>Allow <code>Escape</code> key to close the menu and return focus to the trigger</li>
      </ol>
      
      <pre><code>document.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) {
  if (e.key === 'Escape' && menuIsOpen) {
    closeMenu();
    menuTrigger.focus(); // Return focus to trigger
  }
});</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Modal Dialogs</h3>
      <p>For accessible modal dialogs:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Move focus to the modal when it opens (usually to the heading or close button)</li>
        <li>Trap focus within the modal while it's open</li>
        <li>Return focus to the triggering element when the modal closes</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Custom Controls</h3>
      <p>When creating custom controls like toggles, sliders, or custom selects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Make them focusable with <code>tabindex="0"</code></li>
        <li>Support standard keyboard interactions (e.g., Space/Enter to activate buttons)</li>
        <li>Follow WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for complex widgets</li>
      </ul>
      
      <pre><code>&lt;div role="button"
     tabindex="0"
     aria-pressed="false"
     onclick="toggleFeature()"
     onkeydown="handleKeydown(event)"&gt;
  Toggle Feature
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
function handleKeydown(event) {
  // Activate on Space or Enter key
  if (event.key === ' ' || event.key === 'Enter') {
    event.preventDefault();
    toggleFeature();
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Testing Keyboard Accessibility</h2>
      
      <h3>Manual Testing Checklist</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put away your mouse and navigate the entire site using only the keyboard</li>
        <li>Verify that all interactive elements are reachable using the Tab key</li>
        <li>Confirm that the focus indicator is clearly visible at all times</li>
        <li>Test that all features can be operated using appropriate keyboard controls</li>
        <li>Ensure modals, drawers, and other overlays properly manage focus</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Common Issues to Watch For</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keyboard traps:</strong> Places where focus gets stuck and users can't navigate away</li>
        <li><strong>Invisible focus:</strong> Elements that receive focus but don't show a visible indicator</li>
        <li><strong>Skip links missing:</strong> Long navigation menus without a way to skip to main content</li>
        <li><strong>Custom controls:</strong> Interactive elements that work with mouse but not keyboard</li>
        <li><strong>Off-screen focus:</strong> Focus moving to hidden elements, causing the focus indicator to disappear</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Keyboard navigation is a foundational aspect of web accessibility that benefits many users. By ensuring your site is fully navigable without a mouse, you not only comply with accessibility guidelines but also improve the user experience for everyone.</p>
      
      <p>Remember that proper keyboard support often overlaps with other accessibility requirements, such as screen reader compatibility and support for voice recognition software. When you design with keyboard accessibility in mind, you're taking a significant step toward universal design that works for all users, regardless of their abilities or preferences.</p>

      <h2>Introduction to Accessible Forms</h2>
      <p>Forms are often the primary interaction point between users and websites. Whether completing a purchase, signing up for an account, or submitting feedback, forms are crucial for user engagement. However, they can also present significant accessibility barriers if not properly designed.</p>
      
      <p>Inaccessible forms can prevent users with disabilities from completing essential tasks, leading to frustration and abandonment. By implementing accessible form design, you ensure that all users can successfully interact with your site, regardless of their abilities or the assistive technology they use.</p>
      
      <h2>Labeling Form Controls</h2>
      
      <h3>Use Explicit Labels</h3>
      <p>Always associate form controls with labels using the <code>for</code> attribute that matches the input's <code>id</code>:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!-- Good example --&gt;
&lt;label for="username"&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id="username" type="text" name="username"&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <p>Avoid relying solely on placeholder text for labeling, as it disappears when users start typing and may not be announced correctly by screen readers:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;!-- Problematic example --&gt;
&lt;input type="text" name="username" placeholder="Username"&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Fieldset and Legend for Grouped Controls</h3>
      <p>Use <code>fieldset</code> and <code>legend</code> to group related form controls, especially for radio buttons and checkboxes:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;fieldset&gt;
  &lt;legend&gt;Notification Preferences&lt;/legend&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;input id="email-notifications" type="checkbox" name="notifications" value="email"&gt;
    &lt;label for="email-notifications"&gt;Email notifications&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;input id="sms-notifications" type="checkbox" name="notifications" value="sms"&gt;
    &lt;label for="sms-notifications"&gt;SMS notifications&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/fieldset&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Form Control Accessibility</h2>
      
      <h3>Use Native HTML Elements</h3>
      <p>Whenever possible, use native HTML form controls instead of creating custom ones. Native elements come with built-in accessibility features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keyboard accessibility</li>
        <li>Focus management</li>
        <li>Screen reader announcements</li>
        <li>Mobile device optimization</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Custom Controls</h3>
      <p>If you must create custom form controls, ensure they:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Are focusable using the keyboard (with <code>tabindex="0"</code>)</li>
        <li>Respond to expected keyboard interactions (e.g., Space to toggle checkboxes)</li>
        <li>Have appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties</li>
        <li>Include clear visual focus indicators</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Providing Instructions and Context</h2>
      
      <h3>Clear Field Requirements</h3>
      <p>Communicate field requirements clearly:</p>
      <pre><code>&lt;label for="password"&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;p id="password-requirements" class="form-hint"&gt;
  Password must be at least 8 characters and include a number and a special character.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;input 
  id="password" 
  type="password" 
  name="password" 
  aria-describedby="password-requirements password-error"
  required
  pattern="^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[!@#$%^&*])(.{8,})$"
&gt;
&lt;p id="password-error" class="error-message" role="alert" hidden&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Required Fields</h3>
      <p>Clearly indicate which fields are required:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the <code>required</code> attribute on inputs</li>
        <li>Visually indicate required fields (e.g., with an asterisk)</li>
        <li>Include text explaining your required field indicator</li>
      </ul>
      <pre><code>&lt;p class="form-instructions"&gt;Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;label for="name"&gt;Name *&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input id="name" name="name" type="text" required&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Error Handling</h2>
      
      <h3>Error Prevention</h3>
      <p>Help users avoid errors in the first place:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use appropriate input types (<code>email</code>, <code>tel</code>, <code>date</code>, etc.)</li>
        <li>Provide clear instructions before users interact with the form</li>
        <li>Use client-side validation where appropriate, but don't rely on it exclusively</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Error Identification</h3>
      <p>When errors occur, make them easy to find and understand:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a summary of all errors at the top of the form</li>
        <li>Link directly from the error summary to the corresponding field</li>
        <li>Clearly mark each field with an error</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Clear Error Messages</h3>
      <p>Error messages should:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearly identify what went wrong</li>
        <li>Provide specific guidance on how to fix the issue</li>
        <li>Be announced to screen readers (using <code>aria-live</code> regions or the <code>role="alert"</code> attribute)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <pre><code>&lt;div role="alert" class="error-summary" id="error-summary"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;There are 2 errors in this form&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#email"&gt;Email address is not valid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="#terms"&gt;You must accept the terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
      
      <h2>Specialized Form Controls</h2>
      
      <h3>Date Pickers</h3>
      <p>For date inputs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support different date formats</li>
        <li>Allow keyboard entry as an alternative to calendar selection</li>
        <li>Ensure calendar widgets are keyboard accessible and properly labeled</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>File Uploads</h3>
      <p>For file upload controls:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearly state accepted file types and size limits</li>
        <li>Provide clear feedback during and after upload</li>
        <li>Offer alternative submission methods when appropriate</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Creating accessible forms takes thoughtful planning and implementation, but the results are worth it. Accessible forms not only help users with disabilities but also provide a better experience for everyone. Clear labels, helpful instructions, and effective error handling benefit all users, regardless of their abilities.</p>
      
      <p>Remember that accessibility is an ongoing process. Test your forms with real users, including those who use assistive technologies, and be prepared to make improvements based on their feedback.</p>

      <h2>Manual Testing Approaches</h2>
      
      <h3>Keyboard Navigation Testing</h3>
      <p>Steps for thorough keyboard testing:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Put away your mouse and navigate using only the keyboard (primarily Tab, Shift+Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, and Space)</li>
        <li>Verify that all interactive elements are reachable and operable</li>
        <li>Check that focus indicators are clearly visible</li>
        <li>Test all features, including complex widgets like modals, menus, and custom controls</li>
        <li>Ensure focus is managed appropriately when content changes</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Screen Reader Testing</h3>
      <p>Basic screen reader testing process:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Learn the basics of at least one screen reader (NVDA, VoiceOver, or JAWS)</li>
        <li>Navigate through your site using the screen reader's commands</li>
        <li>Listen for clear and accurate announcements of content</li>
        <li>Verify that all important information is conveyed</li>
        <li>Test common screen reader features like heading navigation, landmark navigation, and form mode</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Popular Screen Readers for Testing</h3>

    "inclusive-design-principles": `
      <h2>What is Inclusive Design?</h2>
      <p>Inclusive design is a methodology that considers the full range of human diversity—including ability, language, culture, gender, age, and other forms of human difference. Unlike accessibility, which often focuses on technical compliance with standards, inclusive design aims to create solutions that work better for everyone by addressing the needs of people who are often excluded from mainstream design considerations.</p>
      
      <p>Microsoft's inclusive design toolkit defines it as "a methodology that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity. Most importantly, this means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives."</p>
      
      <h2>The Core Principles of Inclusive Design</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Recognize Exclusion</h3>
      <p>The first step in inclusive design is to recognize when, where, and how exclusion happens in products, services, and environments. Exclusion can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Permanent:</strong> Such as someone with a permanent disability</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary:</strong> Like someone with a broken arm</li>
        <li><strong>Situational:</strong> For example, a parent holding a child with one arm</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>Understanding these "mismatches" between users and interfaces helps identify opportunities for more inclusive solutions that benefit everyone.</p>
      
      <h3>2. Learn from Diversity</h3>
      <p>People who are "at the edges" of the typical user experience often have insights that can lead to better design for everyone. By engaging with diverse users, especially those with extreme needs or constraints, designers can uncover solutions that might not be obvious when designing only for the "average" user.</p>
      
      <p>Examples of learning from diversity include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The typewriter was originally designed for blind people, but benefited everyone</li>
        <li>Text messages were created for people with hearing impairments, but are now universally used</li>
        <li>Curb cuts were designed for wheelchair users but help parents with strollers, travelers with luggage, and many others</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Solve for One, Extend to Many</h3>
      <p>This principle encourages designers to focus deeply on solving for a specific exclusion scenario, then extending that solution to benefit everyone. By solving for the "extreme" cases first, the resulting solutions are often more robust, innovative, and beneficial for all users.</p>
      
      <h2>Applying Inclusive Design to Web Development</h2>
      
      <h3>Flexible User Interfaces</h3>
      <p>Create interfaces that adapt to different user needs and preferences:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Responsive design</strong> that works across device sizes</li>
        <li><strong>Font size adjustments</strong> for users with vision impairments or reading difficulties</li>
        <li><strong>Color theme options</strong> including high contrast modes</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced motion settings</strong> for users with vestibular disorders</li>
      </ul>
      
      <pre><code>@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  * {
    animation-duration: 0.001ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.001ms !important;
  }
}</code></pre>
      
      <h3>Multiple Ways to Interact</h3>
      <p>Provide different methods for interacting with your content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support both mouse and keyboard navigation</li>
        <li>Implement voice control compatibility</li>
        <li>Allow users to complete tasks through different paths</li>
        <li>Support both touch and pointer precision interactions</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Clear and Flexible Communication</h3>
      <p>Make content understandable to the widest possible audience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Write in plain language</li>
        <li>Offer content in multiple formats (text, video, audio)</li>
        <li>Avoid cultural references that may not translate globally</li>
        <li>Consider translation and localization needs</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Inclusive Design vs. Accessibility</h2>
      <p>While related, inclusive design and accessibility are not identical approaches:</p>
      
      <h3>Accessibility</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Focuses on compliance with specific standards (WCAG)</li>
        <li>Often addresses the needs of people with disabilities specifically</li>
        <li>Can be measured against objective criteria</li>
        <li>Frequently implemented at the end of the design process</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Inclusive Design</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Takes a broader approach considering all forms of human diversity</li>
        <li>Seeks solutions that work better for everyone</li>
        <li>Is more process-oriented than compliance-oriented</li>
        <li>Should be integrated from the beginning of the design process</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>The most effective approach is to combine both: use inclusive design principles throughout the process and ensure compliance with accessibility standards.</p>
      
      <h2>Implementing an Inclusive Design Process</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Diverse Research and Testing</h3>
      <p>Include participants with diverse abilities, backgrounds, and needs in your user research:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Recruit participants across a spectrum of abilities</li>
        <li>Consider cultural and linguistic diversity</li>
        <li>Include older adults and people with temporary limitations</li>
        <li>Observe how people use assistive technologies</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>2. Co-Design and Participatory Methods</h3>
      <p>Involve diverse users as active participants in the design process, not just as test subjects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Conduct co-design workshops with diverse participants</li>
        <li>Create feedback mechanisms that are accessible to all</li>
        <li>Consider hiring consultants with relevant lived experiences</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Iterate with Inclusion in Mind</h3>
      <p>Test early and often with diverse users to catch exclusion early:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Test prototypes with assistive technologies from the beginning</li>
        <li>Identify and eliminate bias in your designs</li>
        <li>Document inclusive design decisions for future reference</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Tools for Inclusive Design</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Simulation tools:</strong> NoCoffee (vision impairment simulator), Inclusive Design Toolkit's Persona Spectrum</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluation tools:</strong> Accessibility checkers, readability analyzers</li>
        <li><strong>Design resources:</strong> Microsoft's Inclusive Design Toolkit, Google's Material Design accessibility guidelines</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Inclusive design is not just about compliance or social responsibility—it leads to better products for everyone. By considering the full range of human diversity and focusing on solving edge cases, we create digital experiences that are more flexible, robust, and usable.</p>
      
      <p>The web was created with the vision of universal access to information and connection. By embracing inclusive design principles, we honor that original vision while creating better experiences for all users, regardless of their abilities or circumstances.</p>
